# ðŸš€ Deploy MediQuick to Railway (Public Access)

Railway is perfect for your needs - it's free, reliable, and gives public access immediately!

## Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository 
4. Choose the backend folder or create a new project
5. Add these environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: `mongodb+srv://your-connection-string` (get from MongoDB Atlas)
   - `JWT_SECRET`: `your-secret-key-here`
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`

## Step 2: Update Frontend Config

After backend deploys, update your frontend to use the Railway backend URL.

## Step 3: Deploy Frontend

Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify with updated backend URL.

## Why Railway Fixes Your Network Errors:

âœ… **No Authentication Barriers** - Anyone can access your deployed app
âœ… **Real Domain** - Not localhost, so no CORS issues  
âœ… **Always Online** - Unlike localhost which stops when you close your computer
âœ… **Fast Global CDN** - Better performance than localhost
âœ… **HTTPS** - Secure connections prevent many network errors

## Environment Variables Needed:

```env
# Required for Railway
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/mediquick
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-minimum-32-characters
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional (app works without these in mock mode)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
```

Your network errors were caused by:
1. Vercel showing login pages instead of your app
2. Frontend trying to connect to localhost (which doesn't exist when deployed)  
3. CORS issues between different domains

Railway solves all of these! ðŸŽ‰
